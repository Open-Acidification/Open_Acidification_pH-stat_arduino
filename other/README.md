A [change](https://github.com/Arduino-CI/arduino_ci/pull/294) to arduino_ci gives us almost a 20x speed improvement. While we are waiting for that fix, we have the option of copying in the appropriate files and installing them in our own copy of the gem. Running `install.sh` does this.

See [this](https://github.com/Open-Acidification/TankController/issues/71) for a removal reminder.
